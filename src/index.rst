**RESEARCH TOPICS**

:Framework - pySPACE:
  `pySPACE <http://pyspace.github.io/pyspace/>`_ is the abbreviation for
  signal processing and classification environment written in Python which
  is supporting parallelization and intuitive configuration (based on YAML).

  I am not the original developer of pySPACE but I am the lead developer
  and I contributed the major parts to it
  like documentation, usability, numerous algorithms, tuned performance,
  classification, regression, evaluation metrics, parameter optimization, etc.
  Furthermore, I was responsible for making this software open source.

  Currently, I am working on optimizing processing chains.
  One of my approaches uses deep learning on EEG data and the other is to
  integrate domain/expert knowledge and the optimization library
  Hyperopt into pySPACE.

:Intelligent Man-Machine Interaction (IMMI):
  I contributed to the proposal of 
  `this project <http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/research/projects/immi.html>`_
  and I have worked in IMMI from 05/10 to 04/15.
  My tasks involved the optimization, descriptive analysis, 
  and online adaptation of data processing chains 
  for electroencephalographic (EEG) data.
  One task to detect the perception of rare infrequent important events
  in contrast to the perception of more frequent but irrelevant in the
  very noisy data.
  The other task was to predict upcoming movements by detecting the
  movement preparation in the EEG.
  Most parts of my thesis are results from my work in this project
  and they are related to support vector machines, 
  decoding of EEG data processing chains, and the processing optimization
  with the framework pySPACE.

:Support Vector Machines (SVMs):
  Due to their generalization capability on few data with high dimensions,
  the SVM is a common classifier in EEG data processing.
  I encountered numerous variants of this algorithm and derived general and
  intuitive concepts how these variants are connected.
  The approaches could be used to improve the understanding of these algorithms
  and to easily teach a class of algorithms to students.
  My concept included the (smooth) connections to linear discriminant analysis,
  support vector regression, relative margin machine, one-class SVM, and
  the online passive-aggressive algorithm.
  Recently, I compared different possibilities of online learning SVMs
  which consider resource limitations.

:Decoding:
  To avoid that a complex data processing chain is relying on artifacts
  it is crucial to determine how it interacts with the data in total.
  I implemented a generic approach to decode (and visualize) 
  these processing chains.
  As a side product, I developed and compared algorithms which are
  capable of reducing the segment length and the number of sensors
  used in the processing of segmented time series data from multiple sensors 
  (e.g., EEG and robotics data).
  Currently, I am working on improving the interpretability with the help
  of source localization methods.

:RECUPERA-Reha:
  I have been mainly supporting this project since 05/2015.
  Its objective is to create a full-body exoskeleton for the support in
  stroke rehabilitation. 
  EEG data is used to improve the exoskeleton control and to get insights
  into the rehabilitation process of the user.
  Additionally to the processing chain decoding, 
  I am contributing with approaches
  that tackle the major problem of too few training data.

:Robotics:
  Even though my main responsibility has always been on EEG data processing,
  I regularly support colleagues with mathematical or machine learning problems
  in robotics.
  This includes processing chain construction/optimization,
  soil detection, sensor fault detection, outlier detection, 
  underwater vehicle movement modeling,
  reinforcement learning, automotive control, etc.
